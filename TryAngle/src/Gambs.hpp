/** DIZ CLAY MUR.
 *
 * This be Gambs.hpp. Where all your dreams come true.
 * More specifically your nightmares.
 *
 * I like this source code for three reasons:
 *
 * 1. It has a lot of sexy seductive code that just turns me on.
 * b. I see dead pixels.
 * III. I reckon you know the third reason... Hush now little dove.
 *
 * Now how to include this header on your code:
 *
 *  - Find a red button. Any will do.
 *  - DO NOT PUSH IT.
 *  - Eventually give in and push it.
 *  - ...
 *  - PROFIT
 *  - ...
 *  - BANKRUPTCY
 *
 * Now that I have your attention:
 *
 * Hey there sexy. You come here often?
 *
 * C-RIO-SLEEP TAI MMMUH:
 *
 * This is the only place where I allow myself to do
 * ugly coding and creative variable names, since it's
 * all going to be obscured by macros and what not.
 *
 * Please don't hate me for that.
 *
 * Love you,
 * Your biological dad
